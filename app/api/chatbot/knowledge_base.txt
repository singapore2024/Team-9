3. Farming Best Practices
Home Gardening:

Choosing the Right Plants:
Select plants suited to your local climate and the space available in your home garden. Herbs, leafy greens, and compact vegetables are ideal for small spaces.
Soil Preparation:
Use a mix of nutrient-rich soil and compost for the best results. For most plants, soil should be loose, well-draining, and pH balanced.
Watering Techniques:
Water early in the morning or late in the evening to prevent evaporation. Avoid overwatering, as it can lead to root rot.
Large-Scale Farming:

Crop Rotation:
Rotate crops each season to prevent soil depletion and reduce pest problems. For example, rotate between legumes, grains, and vegetables.
Sustainable Practices:
Utilize organic fertilizers and pest control methods. Cover crops, mulching, and integrated pest management are effective strategies.
Soil Health Monitoring:
Regularly test soil health to maintain an ideal balance of nutrients. Amend soil with compost or organic fertilizers as needed.
Pest and Disease Management:

Companion Planting:
Plant herbs like basil or marigolds near vegetables to repel pests. Companion planting can naturally deter pests and improve plant growth.
Natural Pest Control:
Use neem oil, insecticidal soaps, or introduce beneficial insects like ladybugs and lacewings to control pest populations.
